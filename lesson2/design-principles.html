        <p>
          The Track list on the bottom is a great example of alignment. Each of
          the numbers are in horizontal alignment. They then have a nice use of
          white space between the numbers and the track names. This and the
          color change show that they are not one thing, but define each other.
          The track names have a left alignment which create a clean apparence.
          This makes it easier to read than if they had say a center alignment.

        <h3>Contrast</h3>
        <p>
          Big Hit (BTS Map of the Soul 7)
          <br /><br />
          <a
            target="_blank"
            href="https://ibighit.com/bts/eng/discography/detail/map_of_the_soul-7.html"

        <figure>
          <img src="images/contrast.jpg" alt="#" />
        </figure>
        <p>
          Here we have a wonderful example of contrast. The white text over top
          of the blue background aids in easy reading for the user. The
          different font sizes add to the contrast as well as visual hierarchy,
          telling the reader where to look next. You see a little of the text at
          the bottom that is not as bright white as the beginning text and that
          helps to define that it is not as important as the text before.

          Become (Come Unto Christ)

        <p>
          This shot of the Become website is a great example of the use of white
          space. Nothing feels cramped together. They gave each section room to
          itself. This is especially important on mobile as you have to give
          space for the buttons to be pressed. They also added a good amount of
          padding to the sign up button and between it and the sign in button.
          This makes for a user friendly experience.
