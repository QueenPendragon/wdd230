          The City of Mesa has a complex and rich history. From its prehistoric
          roots to today’s dynamic business and residential community, Mesa has
          seen it all. The first prehistoric people to live in Mesa were the
          Hohokams who flourished in the valley for over 1,500 years. They were
          farmers and canal builders who lived in large communities of up to 500
          people. They are best remembered for their construction of a large
          network of irrigation canals. The prehistoric Hohokam canals were
          incredible works of labor and engineering. The hand dug system,
          irrigated over 110,000 acres and was the largest in the prehistoric
          world. ​<br />
          ​<br />
          The Hohokam irrigation system transformed the soils of the Salt River
          Valley, allowing them to grow abundant crops for their use and for
          trade. The Hohokam traded cotton cloth for seashells from the Gulf of
          California and for exotic birds from the Yucatan. Eventually, the
          Hohokam began to move from the area as they experienced a period of
          overpopulation, nutritional stress, and warfare. They disappeared from
          the area by around 1450 and there has been no explanation as to where
          they went. ​<br />
          Between the time of the decline of the Hohokam culture in the 15th
          century and the mid 1800’s, no long-term settlement existed in the
          Mesa area. Intermittent conflicts between the Pima and Maricopa along
          the Gila River and the Yavapai and the Apaches in the Salt River
          Valley, ensured that the region would not be settled during that time.
          It was not until the establishment of Fort McDowell by the United
          States Army on 1865 that permanent settlement was created in the area.
          The effectiveness of the Fort helped to pave the way for Anglo
          settlements in Phoenix, Tempe, and Mesa. ​<br />

          1877, the first pioneers settled the Mesa Area. Sent from Utah by
          Brigham Young, the “Utah Company” was originally sent to establish
          “stations on the road” supporting the Church’s expansion into Mexico.
          They built their first homes and businesses in what is known as Lehi,
          now in Northern Mesa. The rich soil near the Salt River was perfect
          for growing crops. The Pima and Maricopa living in the area helped the
          pioneers carve out a life in the desert. Additionally, Tempe founder
          Charles Hayden loaned money to the company and other resources to help
          the colony create a community. ​<br />
          ​​<br />

          The second group of Mormon settlers to arrive in the area was known as
          the Mesa Company. Arriving on 1878, this group distinguished
          themselves by settling on the mesa top and by clearing ancient Native
          American canals so that water could be diverted to the higher ground.
          By the early 1880’s, nearly 300 people had settled in the Mesa area,
          most living within one square mile of downtown. ​<br />
          Cultural, diversity has been a part of Mesa’s history from the
          earliest days of the settlement. The people who made up the companies
          of the Mormon pioneers, white Europeans in terms of ethic background,
          and the Native American people already living in the area were soon
          joined by other immigrants including African Americans, Chinese,
          Mexican, Japanese, and Arabs, came to farm, to open businesses, and to
          work construction. The town saw a major boom as construction of nearby
          Roosevelt Dam brought ample opportunity for work and leisure in town.
          ​<br />
          Agriculture was the foundation of the Mesa economy until after World
          War II. Dairy farming and stock-raising were an ever-increasing sector
          of the agricultural economy. Much of the Mesa workforce was employed
          in agricultural-related industries. Surprisingly, agriculture was an
          important factor in attracting tourists to Mesa by the early 20th
          century. The Roosevelt Dam became a main attraction along with
          prehistoric ruins including the Hohokam ceremonial site Mesa Grande.

          In the years following WWII, the economy underwent a major
          transformation. Many factors were at work, including the mechanization
          of farming, the availability of affordable air conditioning units that
          made living year-round in the desert comfortable, the advent of the
          cold war, and the rising popularity of the Old West. The economy began
          to change from agriculture to one based on the high tech, tourism, and
          service industries. ​<br />
          ​​<br />

          Over the years, the little town that began as a “station on the road,”
          continued to thrive. The population doubled every decade except during
          the 1920’s, and the city soon far outgrew its original one-square-mile
          boundary. The road has not always been easy for the citizens of Mesa.
          The city has endured epidemics, two major depressions, and has sent
          its sons and daughters off to two World Wars. Extreme heat, floods,
          and drought have also tested the spirit of its people. ​<br />
          ​​<br />

          Unfortunately prejudice and racism have also impacted nearly all of
          Mesa’s diverse communities to varying degrees over the years. African
          American residents felt the impact of this more than any other group.
          Limited as to where they could buy homes and where they could send
          their children to school, black Americans had to work hard for even
          their basic rights. Until desegregation took place in the 1950’s, many
          minority citizens found themselves segregated in parks, swimming
          pools, movie theaters, dance halls, restaurants, and just about
          anywhere else local residents might congregate for business, play, and
          social activities. Arizona was also the site of relocation camps for
          many Japanese Americans during World War II. However, since the end of
          that war and the desegregation that followed, ethnic minorities have
          made great strides. Their stories-good, bad, and in-between-are as
          much a part of Mesa as any that might be told. ​<br />
          In May 1979, the city was named an All American City by the National
          Municipal League. Mesa was honored for its efforts to address
          community problems through cooperation among citizens, schools, civic
          groups, and local governments, including the Salt River Pima-Maricopa
          Indian Community. ​<br />

          Today the city of Mesa is a thriving desert community bounded on all
          sides by smaller neighboring towns. The only other city in Central
          Arizona that is larger than Mesa is Phoenix. It is the 35th largest
          city in America and boasts a population of over 500,000. ​<br />
          Mesa was among the first in the region to recognize the importance of
          baseball as a community asset. Countless Major League Players came to
          Mesa to play ball and to take in the rejuvenating waters at the
          Buckhorn Baths. Mesa now boasts two teams and two stadiums, a first
          for any valley community. In addition, Mesa has attracted industry
          giants like Boeing, General Motors, and Tally Industries while
          developing the old Williams Air Force Base into a full-scale regional
          and commercial airport. In addition to boasting the largest community
          college in the nation, Mesa has attracted multiple educational
          institutions from around the nation have established college
          facilities in Mesa. The city is also a leader in producing a thriving
          cultural economy with multiple museums and the Mesa Arts Center. ​<br />
          Without a doubt, Mesa will continue to grow and create an identity of
          its own in the Salt River Valley for years to come.
